# py_led_controller

A Python application that monitors Google Meet tabs in Safari and controls an LED strip via Bluetooth. The LED turns red when a Meet tab is active, providing a visual indicator of meeting status. Perfect for home office setups to avoid interruptions during meetings.

## Features

- Monitors Safari tabs for Google Meet
- Controls LED strip via Bluetooth
- Non-intrusive monitoring (doesn't force Safari to open)
- Background operation with proper logging
- Easy start/stop scripts

## Open Source

This project is open source and released under the MIT License. Being open source means:

- üÜì Free to use for any purpose
- üîß Free to modify and adapt
- üì¶ Free to distribute
- üîç Free to inspect the code
- ü§ù Free to contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether it's:
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Documentation improvements
- Code optimizations
- Or any other enhancements

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- macOS (for Safari monitoring)
- Bluetooth-enabled LED strip (ELK-BLEDOB compatible)
- Required Python packages:
  - bleak
  - asyncio

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/py_led_controller.git
cd py_led_controller
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

The default configuration uses the following settings:
- LED device address: "61C008D6-5838-2D1B-F300-86F1AAFB172B"
- Check interval: 1 second
- Pleasant color: Soft blue (0, 100, 255)
- Meet detection color: Red (255, 0, 0)

To modify these settings, edit the respective values in `meet_led_monitor.py`.

## Usage

### Starting the Monitor

To start the monitor in the background:
```bash
./start_meet_monitor.sh
```

This will:
- Start the monitor in the background
- Create a log file (meet_monitor.log)
- Save the process ID for later stopping

### Stopping the Monitor

To stop the monitor:
```bash
./stop_meet_monitor.sh
```

### Checking Status

The monitor's status and all events are logged in `meet_monitor.log`. You can check the current status with:
```bash
tail -f meet_monitor.log
```

## Project Structure

- `meet_led_monitor.py`: Main application file
- `led_controller.py`: LED strip control module
- `safari_controller.py`: Safari monitoring module
- `start_meet_monitor.sh`: Script to start the monitor
- `stop_meet_monitor.sh`: Script to stop the monitor
- `meet_monitor.log`: Log file (created when running)
- `meet_monitor.pid`: Process ID file (created when running)

## How It Works

1. The monitor checks Safari tabs every second
2. If a Google Meet tab is found:
   - LED turns red
   - Status is logged
3. If no Meet tabs are found:
   - LED returns to pleasant blue
   - Status is logged
4. All events are logged with timestamps

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. LED not connecting:
   - Check if the device address is correct
   - Ensure Bluetooth is enabled
   - Verify the LED strip is powered on

2. Safari monitoring not working:
   - Ensure Safari is running
   - Check if you have permission to control Safari
   - Verify the script has necessary permissions

3. Script not starting:
   - Make sure the scripts are executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x start_meet_monitor.sh
     chmod +x stop_meet_monitor.sh
     ```

### Logs

Check `meet_monitor.log` for detailed information about:
- Connection status
- Meet detection
- LED color changes
- Any errors or warnings
